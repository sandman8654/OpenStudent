# Terminate an EC2 instance, and remove its DNS record as well.
# Any additional EBS volumes are detached but are not affected (the root
# EBS volume will be terminated by default).  This isn't very clever 
# and is intended only for the happy path of "destroying an instance created
# by a create script."
#
# It doesn't block to wait until the instance is actually terminated, just
# that it starts shutting down.
#
# example: scripts/base_destroy.sh rails2005
