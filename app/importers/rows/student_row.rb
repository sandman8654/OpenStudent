class StudentRow < Struct.new(:row, :school_ids_dictionary)
  # Represents a row in a CSV export from Somerville's Aspen X2 student information system.
  # Some of those rows will enter Student Insights, and the data in the CSV will be written into the database
  # (see name_view_attributes, demographic_attributes, school_attribute).
  # 
  # Contrast with student.rb, which is represents a student once they've entered the DB.
  # 
  # Not every student row enters the database. For example, as of 2016-05-14, a student row
  # representing a high school student won't ever enter the database.
  # 
  # Expects the following headers:
  #
  #   :state_id, :local_id, :full_name, :home_language, :program_assigned,
  #   :limited_english_proficiency, :sped_placement, :disability,
  #   sped_level_of_need: :plan_504, :student_address, :grade,
  #   :registration_date, :free_reduced_lunch, :homeroom, :school_local_id
