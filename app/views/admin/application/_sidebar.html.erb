# Sidebar

This partial is used to display the sidebar in Administrate.
By default, the sidebar contains navigation links
for all resources in the admin dashboard,
as defined by the routes in the `admin/` namespace

Not needed in Student Insights because we are only exposing
Educators to the admin interface. All other models and attributes
are governed by data from X2 and STAR.
