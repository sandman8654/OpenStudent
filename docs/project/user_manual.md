# What Students Insights Does:
* Replaces the paper classroom rosters that Kenya creates using real-time data
* Allows you to see the history of a student (assessments, attendance, discipline, demographics, interventions)
* Serves as a tool for MTSS and SST teams to enter notes and interventions for students
* Generates a student profile needed for a SPED referral (rollout in May)
* Provides an inquiry dashboard that allows for administrators and teams to dig deeper into their student body
* Ensures data security and student privacy (including different levels of user permissions)

# Essential Practices for MTSS & STT Teams:
1.  At each meeting, make sure there is an LCD projector or Smartboard attached to a laptop, so everyone can view the student profile, notes, and services
2.  Everyone at the table should know and practice how to add notes/services (rotating model)
3.  Show teachers how they can access their classroom rosters and individual profiles (using their email address and X2 password)
4.  Any errors should be shared immediately with Alex (asoble@gmail.com), Kevin (kevin.robinson.0@gmail.com), or Uri (uharel@k12.somerville.ma.us)

# Major Features In The Pipeline for 2016-2017:
* Ability to add attachments (ex. student work) to notes
* Adding additional data points (ex. F&P, gradebook, custom)
* Analytics – “How well does ____________ intervention work?”
* Alert System – “This student is struggling, but not receiving services….There has been no follow-up since the last MTSS meeting….”
* Expansion to other districts that use X2

# Guidelines for Entering Notes and Services:
The **Notes** tab is the place to keep notes about a student, whether it’s SST, MTSS, a parent conversation, or some informal strategies that a teacher/team is using to help a student.

*Who can enter a note?*  Anyone who works with or involved with the student, including classroom/ELL/SPED teachers, principals/assistant principals, counselors, and attendance officers.

*What can I/should I put in a note?* The true test is to think about whether the information will help your team down the road in supporting this student, either in the coming weeks, or a few years from now.  Examples include:
*   “Oscar just showed a 20 point increase in ORF.  It seems like the take home readings are working (parents are very supportive) and we will continue it.”
*   “This is a follow-up MTSS meeting for Julie.  Over the last 4 weeks, she is not showing many gains despite the volunteer tutor and the change in seating….”
*   “Alex just got an M on the latest F&P.  Will try having him go next door to join the other 4th grade group during guided reading.”
*  “Medicine change for Uri on 4/10.  So far slight increase in focus.”
*  “51a filed on 3/21.  Waiting determination and follow-up from DCF.”
*  “Just found that Cora really likes to go help out in grade 1.  Best incentive yet for when she stays on task and completes work.”
*  “Arranged for Kevin to go to community schools 2x/week and to get extra homework help.”
*  “Julia will do an FBA and report back at the next SST meeting to determine sources of the behavior.”
*  “Mediation occurred between Oscar and Uri and went well.  Both have agreed to keep distance for 2 weeks.”
*  “Parent called to report that Jill won art award and will be going to nationals.  She suggested this might be an outlet if she shows frustration in schoolwork.”

The **Services** tab is place to keep track of more formal extensive interventions for a student.  It includes a specific person responsible and dates.

* Reading Teacher: Student works with a reading specialist at least 4x/week for 30-40 minutes.
* Behavior/Attendance Contract: This is usually done in cooperation with the attendance officer, school adjustment counselor, and/or principal.  This is a more formal document that requires a parent and student signature, along with regular checkpoints.
* Attendance Officer: This usually includes home visit(s), regular follow-up, and could later on lead to a formal attendance contract.
* Counseling: Student receives regular weekly or bi-weekly counseling from an SPS counselor or outside (ex. Riverside, Home for Little Wanderers).    One time or infrequent check-ins by a counselor should just be recorded in notes.
